# Red Black Tree Implementation

## The repository contains:
- The `header` directory: contains `.h` files for declaring class.
- The `source` directory: contains implementation.
- `build_and_run.sh`: shell code for compiling and run source code.
- `main`: just executable to run.
- The `test` directory: contains accepted source code for [VNOI - CPPSET](https://oj.vnoi.info/problem/cppset) problem. I have submitted for checking the correctness of the Red Black Tree implementation.

## How to run:
```
bash build_and_run.sh
```
